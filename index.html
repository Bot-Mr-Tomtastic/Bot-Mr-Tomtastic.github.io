								<p>My name is Thomas Hoffmann and I am a responsible developer, organized, able to create blogs, web apps, websites and learn new frameworks. I mainly use JavaScript, HTML5 with CSS but now I am starting to program with PHP, and so far I am enjoying it. The frameworks that I have used are Angular 9, Laravel and jQuery. My ideal job is a place where I am able to work in I.T. department creating dynamic and flexible blogs and 4D web apps at low cost as well as being able to create and manage databases with impenetrable security.. By the way, check out some of my <a href="https://github.com/Bot-Mr-Tomtastic/">work</a>.</p>
